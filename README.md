# Getting AWS machine set up 

Adapted instructions from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25185405/using-gpu-from-a-docker-container.

Use ami-2cbf3e44 on an US East AWS machine with GPUs and at least 20gb of space, or follow instructions here http://tleyden.github.io/blog/2014/10/25/cuda-6-dot-5-on-aws-gpu-instance-running-ubuntu-14-dot-04/ to setup CUDA from scratch. 
 
Clone this repo onto the machine. 

Install docker and the torch-local container using the install-docker.sh script.
